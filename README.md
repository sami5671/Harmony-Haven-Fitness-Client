## AOS Animate On Scroll:

In my project, the AOS (Animate On Scroll) feature is utilized to create dynamic and engaging user experiences. AOS triggers animations, such as fading in elements or flipping images, as the user scrolls down the page. These animations are carefully timed and configured to enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of my website, making it more immersive and user-friendly.
